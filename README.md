# On-My-Way-
On My Way! is an android app designed to keep you safe. You punch in your emergency contacts, let it know when you’re somewhere dangerous, and On My Way will text you a little later to see if you’re okay. If you don’t respond, it sends your starting location, arrival destination, and last tracked location with a custom message that alerts your emergency contacts that something may be wrong.
